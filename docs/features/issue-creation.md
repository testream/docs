## Steps to Create an Issue

1. Click the **"Create Issue"** button next to any failed test
2. Review the pre-filled issue form:
   - **Summary** - Auto-populated with test name
   - **Description** - Includes error message and test context
   - **Project** - Select destination Jira project
   - **Issue Type** - Choose Bug, Task, etc.
3. The following custom fields are automatically populated:
   - **Test Run ID** - Links back to the specific test execution
   - **Test Name** - Full test identifier
   - **Environment** - Where the test failed (staging, production, etc.)
4. Click **"Create"** to generate the issue

The created issue will contain all context needed for developers to investigate and fix the failure.
