# Dashboard

Monitor your test suite's overall health with an intuitive dashboard that displays key metrics, test result distributions, and recent test runs — all at a glance.

![Dashboard Overview](/img/jira/Dashboard-Screenshot.png)

## Test Metrics Cards

At the top of the dashboard, you'll see key metrics:

- **Total Tests** - Complete count of all tests in your suite
- **Pass Rate** - Overall success percentage
- **Failed Tests** - Number of currently failing tests
- **Skipped Tests** - Count of intentionally skipped tests
- **Flaky Tests** - Tests with inconsistent pass/fail behavior

## Test Results Distribution

The donut chart visualizes your test results breakdown showing passed, failed, and skipped tests. This provides an at-a-glance view of test suite health.

## Recent Test Runs

Below the metrics, you'll find a chronological list of recent test executions showing:

- Test run timestamp
- Duration
- Pass/fail counts
- Quick action buttons

## Action Buttons
